# CHIP Manufacturer Specific example

This folder contains a variety of different examples provided by manufacturers
that contributed to the CHIP project. The one things that all these examples
have in common is that they're meant to run on a manufacturer specific dev kit
with the required hardware (sensors, rgb led, etc..).
